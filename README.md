# Please take care of my cat! :cat:

Delta is the best cat, but unfortunately I'm the type to travel a lot. Depending on which of my friends are in town, I'll have various folks pitch in to take care of her - which means everybody ends up asking me the same questions.

- Is she friendly? *yes*
- How much do I feed her? *doesn't really matter, as long as it isn't too little*
- Is cleaning cat litter a pain? *only a little!*

To help answer these questions and more I built this terrible little webpage. Please enjoy :rocket:
