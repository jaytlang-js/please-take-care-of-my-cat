                Are you in San Diego? Does your life lack meaningful purpose? Do you
                like small fluffy friends? Because I'm headed out of town for the
                next <strong>5 days</strong>, giving <em>you</em> the opportunity to
                hang out with the <em>best cat ever</em>.

                    Delta is <em>extremely</em> self sufficient, and only needs a visit
                    once every <strong>2 days</strong>, for around <strong>30 minutes per
                    visit.</strong>

            <li>
                <!-- <img>  -->
                <caption>
                    Whenever you visit, just give Delta a <strong>full cup</strong> of dry
                    food, which you'll find atop my fridge. This will last the cat
                    <strong>2 days</strong> at <strong>1/2 cup</strong> per day.

                <caption>
                    My cat is a strange beast... she <strong>loves</strong> drinking from
                    an actual cup of water. So no need to clean up spills from a messy
                    cat bowl -- just pour her an ice water like a normal human, and she'll
                    handle the rest.

                    Everybody hates litter, but Delta's poops are easy - typically dry,
                    small, and not-so-smelly. Just load whatever you can scoop out into
                    a plastic bag, and <strong>toss it in the dumpster out back</strong>.
                    No litter changes needed -- it'll all last til I get back.

            "Delta is far and away the easiest cat I've ever
            taken care of. She's also very strange... her scratching post is a 2 by 4
            just laying on the floor, she plays fetch shockingly well, and she keeps
            trying to get her white hair all over my black dress. But I won't let her."
